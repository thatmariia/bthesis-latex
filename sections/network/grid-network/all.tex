\subsection{The network}
\label{sec:grid-network}

The network considered in this thesis is an oscillatory network that represents a patch of neural networks in V1. Each PING network stands for an oscillator reflecting a neural circuit in V1, which interacts with other neural circuits in this area through lateral connections.
In this oscillatory network, a group of oscillators is arranged in a $n \times n$ grid similar to the network illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:oscillatory-grid-graph}.

This oscillatory network can be represented as a complete weighted directed graph $D = (V, E)$, where the set of vertices $V$ represents all neurons in the network, and the set of edges $E$ represents the synapses. Structurally, the oscillatory network connects $n^2$ identical subgraphs, each representing a PING network. Each subgraph contains the same number of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. An example of such a subgraph is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:single-ping-graph}. 
The cost function $\cost: E \to \mathbb{R}$ for the graph $D$ that reflects the interactions between neurons is defined later in Equation (\ref{eq:cost-function}).

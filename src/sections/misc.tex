Now, the oscillation \todo{oscillation of what exactly?} frequency $f$ and angular frequency $\omega$ of the network $v$ can be obtained through the local contrast:
\begin{gather}
    f_v = 25 + 0.25 \cdot \LC_v, \\
    \omega_v = 2 \pi f_v.
\end{gather}
These relations reflect the typical gamma frequency of a neural network in V1.
\\ \todo{Reference? Where is this relation coming from?}

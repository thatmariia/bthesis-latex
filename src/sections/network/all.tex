\section{Neural model}
\label{sec:grid-ping}

The stimulation of neural circuits, such as the induction of electrical transmembrane currents, can cause changes in the electrical potential across the membranes of neurons \cite{IzhikevichBook2004:2}. These changes can result in fluctuations in neural membrane potential. 
When the input currents surpass a certain threshold, they can cause a sudden and temporary change in the membrane potential that can be transmitted to other neurons: postsynaptic neurons receiving stimulation from presynaptic neurons fire an action potential if the summation of their presynaptic input surpasses a threshold, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:action-potential}. In addition, the presynaptic input can be inhibitory or excitatory, depending on the type of presynaptic neurons. Inhibitory neurons release neurotransmitters that reduce the probability of, or inhibit, the firing of an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron; excitatory neurons release neurotransmitters that increase that likelihood. 

In the pyramidal interneuron network gamma (PING) model, the interplay between a group of pyramidal neurons and interneurons gives rise to synchronous rhythmic spikes in the gamma frequency range (25-80 Hz)  \cite{Whittington2000, Borgers2003}. Pyramidal neurons use the excitatory neurotransmitter AMPA to stimulate other neurons, while interneurons use the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to reduce the activity of neurons. The schematic architecture of the network is presented in Figure \ref{fig:single-ping}.

Specifically, in this network, gamma oscillations are instigated by the input to excitatory neurons, followed by inhibitory feedback \cite{Whittington2000}. When there is enough excitatory activity, pyramidal cells excite fast-spiking (FS) interneurons, which then become depolarized and inhibit the pyramidal neurons. The inhibition of the pyramidal cells stops the depolarization of the FS neurons, ending their inhibitory effect.
This creates a time interval for the pyramidal cells to fire again until they are inhibited by the FS cells. This creates a feedback loop that can generate sustained gamma oscillations in the network \cite{Kopell2011}.

\section{A grid network of PING oscillators}

The external stimulation of neural circuits, such as induction of electrical currents, produces electrical transmembrane currents resulting in neural membrane potential fluctuations \cite{IzhikevichBook2004:2}. Input currents surpassing a threshold give rise to an abrupt and transient change of membrane potential that propagates to other neurons (an action potential, see Section \ref{sec:action-potential}): postsynaptic neurons receiving stimulation from presynaptic neurons fire if the summation of their presynaptic input surpasses a threshold. Afterward, the neuron resets its membrane potential. The spiking state of the neuron can be transient or stable depending on the type of neuron and the strength of the input current (or pulse). In addition, the presynaptic input can be inhibitory or excitatory depending on the type of presynaptic neurons. Inhibitory neurons release neurotransmitters that reduce the probability of, or inhibit, the firing of an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron; excitatory neurons release neurotransmitters that increase that likelihood. 

In the pyramidal interneuron network gamma (PING) model, the interplay between a group of  excitatory (e.g., pyramidal cells) and inhibitory neurons (e.g., fast-spiking basket cells) gives rise to synchronous rhythmic spikes in gamma frequency range (25-80 Hz)  \cite{Whittington2000}, \cite{Borgers2003}. The schematic architecture of the network is presented in Figure \ref{fig:single-ping}.

Specifically, in this network, the gamma oscillations are instigated by the input to excitatory neurons followed by inhibitory feedback \cite{Whittington2000}. In conditions of sufficient excitatory drive, pyramidal cells excite fast-spiking (FS) neurons. FS neurons then become depolarized and inhibit the pyramidal neurons, thus creating a loop. The suppression of pyramidal cells stops the depolarization of FS cells and, therefore, stops their inhibitory effect (i.e., suppression of pyramidal cells). This provides a time interval for pyramidal cells to fire again until they cause their inhibition through FS cells again. Then the excitatory cells spike again, repeating the cycle \cite{Kopell2011}.

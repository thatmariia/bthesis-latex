\subsection{Current composition}
\label{sec:current-composition}

The excitatory neurons are subjected to the effects of external stimuli, which contribute to the current ($I_v$) in Equation (\ref{eq:Izhikevich-model-dp-dt}). Additionally, in the network, neurons are not isolated, and the current involves the accumulated effect of interactions with other neurons. Finally, the network is subjected to noise. 
Hence, the equation for the current $I_v$ includes the input current from the external stimulus $I_{\stim}$ as well as the coupling weights $K$ between the neurons, the current involving the effects of synaptic potentials GABA (inhibitory) and AMPA (excitatory) $I_{\syn}$, and noise $I_\noise$:
\begin{gather}
    I_v = 
    \sum_{w \in V} \cost_{(v \to w)} + I_\noise + I_{\stim, v} \mathbb{1} \{ \type(v) = \ex \},  \label{eq:current-components} \\
    \cost_{(v \to w)} = K_{(v \to w)} \cdot I_{\syn, w}. 
    \label{eq:cost-function}
\end{gather}

\begin{comment}

The definition of each component is provided in the next three sections.

In this project, the external input ($I_{\stim}$) is provided by a set of texture stimuli, and a grid network of PING oscillators is supposed to reflect local neural networks of the primary visual cortex (V1). The external stimuli is described in Section \ref{sec:external-stimuli}.

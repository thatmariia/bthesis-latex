\subsubsection{Coupling}

The interaction strength of lateral connections is represented by a matrix of coupling weights $K: E \to \mathbb{R}$, in which $K_{(v \to w)}$ is the coupling weight between the neurons $v$ and $w$. 
The coupling weight between each pair of neurons is defined by an exponential function decaying with the euclidean distance in the visual cortex between the oscillators they belong to \cite{Lowet2015}. 

The PING networks in Figure \ref{fig:oscillatory-grid-graph} are reduced to the point oscillators as portrayed in Figure \ref{fig:oscillatory-point-grid}. In the visual field, we assume the unit distance between the neighbouring PING networks. Then the coupling weigh between the neurons $v$ and $w$ is
\begin{equation}
    K_{(v \to w)} = C_{\type(v) \to \type(w)} \exp \left( \frac{-\| \cmap(v), \cmap(w) \|}{s_{\type(v) \to \type(w)}} \right),
    \label{eq:coupling-weights}
\end{equation}
where $C$ and $s$ are connectivity dependent values representing the maximum connection strength between neurons and the decay rate of connectivity over space, respectively. The values for these constants are presented in Table \ref{tab:connectivity-network-constants}.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:receptive-field}, the receptive field varies in size with distance to the fovea and occupies a three-dimensional space. So, a two-dimensional stimulus projected onto the receptive field gets distorted. Therefore, a non-linear mapping is required to predict its location in the cortex.
The function $\cmap: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ in Equation (\ref{eq:coupling-weights}) maps the coordinates of a grid element from the visual field to the visual cortex. Since the mapping depends on the location of the stimulus in the visual field, we first need to determine the coordinates of the neurons' locations there. Hence, the function $\cmap$ is defined later in Section \ref{sec:cortical-coords}.

Let $\loc: V \to \mathbb{Z}_+^2$ be a function mapping a neuron to the position of the oscillator it belongs to in the grid, assuming the unit distance between the neighbouring PING networks.

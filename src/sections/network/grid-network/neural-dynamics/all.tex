\subsection{Neural dynamics}
\label{sec:neural-dynamics}

A common approach to systematically simulate a PING network involves the definition of neural dynamics through the Izhikevich type neuron model  \cite{Izhikevich2003}. This model is biologically plausible enough to mimic genuine neural behavior, yet it is computationally more efficient for large-scale simulations than more biophysically accurate models. There, every neuron is a dynamical system that can be described with a two-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations: for all $v \in V$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{dp_v}{dt} =\ & 0.04 p_v^2 + 5p_v + 140 - r_v + I_v,
    \label{eq:Izhikevich-model-dv-dt} \\
    \frac{dr_v}{dt} =\ & \alpha_{\type(v)} \cdot (\beta_{\type(v)} p_v - r_v), \label{eq:Izhikevich-model-dr-dt} \\
    \text{if } p_v \geq\ & p_{\thres} \text{, then } 
    \begin{cases}
        p_v \leftarrow \gamma_{\type(v)} \\
        r_v \leftarrow r_v + \zeta_{\type(v)}
    \end{cases}, 
    \label{eq:Izhikevich-model-p30}
\end{align}
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p_\thres$ is the threshold membrane potential ($= 30$ mV);
    
    \item $p$ represents the membrane potential of the neuron; 
    
    \item $r$ represents a membrane recovery variable, which dramatically increases after spikes; it provides negative feedback that suppresses the increase of $p$ and reduces the fluctuations in the output;
    
    \item $\alpha$ describes the timescale of $r$, it is proportional to the recovery speed;
    
    \item $\beta$ describes the sensitivity of $r$ to the subthreshold fluctuations of the membrane potential $p$: greater values of $\beta$ lead to stronger coupling between $p$ and $r$, resulting in more possible subthreshold oscillations;
    
    \item $\gamma$ describes the after-spike reset value of $p$;
    
    \item $\zeta$ describes the after-spike reset value of $r$;
    
    \item $I$ describes the current.
\end{itemize}
The constants in Equation (\ref{eq:Izhikevich-model-dv-dt}) have been obtained by fitting the spike initiation of neural dynamics in such a way that $p$ has a scale of \textit{mV}, and $t$ - a scale of \textit{ms}.
The effects the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \zeta$ have on membrane potential and recovery are visualized in Figure \ref{fig:neural-dynamics}.

The parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \zeta$ correspond to known types of neurons. The parameters' values for regular spiking (RS) excitatory and fast spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons used in this thesis are displayed in Table \ref{tab:params-izhikevich-model}. When a stimulus is applied, RS neurons typically first fire with a short interspike period, which later increases (see Figure \ref{fig:neuron-types-rs}). Thus, this neuron type corresponds to the large value of $\zeta$, which causes an after-spike jump in $r$. FS neurons produce periodic spikes with high frequency, hence the extremely low value of $\alpha$, which allows for fast recovery (see Figure \ref{fig:neuron-types-fs}).

\paragraph{Current composition}

In the network, neurons are not isolated, and the current ($I_v$) in Equation (\ref{eq:Izhikevich-model-dv-dt}) involves the accumulated effect of interactions with other neurons. Hence, the equation must include the input current ($I_{\stim}$) as well as the coupling weights between the neurons ($K$), and the effects of synaptic potentials GABA-A (inhibitory) and AMPA (excitatory; $I_{\syn}$):
\begin{gather}
    I_v = 
    \sum_{w \in V} \cost_{(v \to w)} + I_{\stim, v} \mathbb{1} \{ \type(v) = \ex \},  \label{eq:current-components} \\
    \cost_{(v \to w)} = K_{v, w} \cdot I_{\syn, w}. 
    \label{eq:cost-function}
\end{gather}

In this project, the external input ($I_{\stim}$) is provided by a set of texture stimuli, and a grid network of PING oscillators is supposed to reflect local neural networks of the primary visual cortex (V1). The external stimuli is described in Section \ref{sec:external-stimuli}.

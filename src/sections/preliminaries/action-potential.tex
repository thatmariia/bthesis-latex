\subsection{Action potential}
\label{sec:action-potential}

A neuron at rest (non-spiking) has a voltage across its membrane called the resting membrane potential \cite{KandelBook2003:6}. In a typical neuron, it varies from $-70$ to $-60$ mV relative to the outside of the cell. So, at rest, the inside of the cell is more negative than the outside. A typical neuron receives inputs from more than 10,000 others through synapses \cite{IzhikevichBook2004:2}; the transmission of signals between neurons is generally carried by neurotransmitter chemicals \cite{KandelBook2003:6}. These can stimulate a deviation from the resting potential, which is characterized by a neuron becoming either
\begin{itemize}
    \item depolarized (membrane potential becomes greater than resting potential) or
    
    \item hyperpolarized (membrane potential becomes smaller than resting potential).
\end{itemize}

The outcome of hyperpolarization is almost always passive and diminishes quickly, i.e., the membrane potential returns to its resting state shortly. Additionally, its size is proportional to the size of the applied stimulus. However, depolarization often leads to a different outcome. When a certain threshold value is surpassed, an all-or-none action potential, or a spike, is produced. The spike initiating threshold varies between $-60$ and $-40$ mV \cite{Platkiewicz2010}. 

During the spikes, membrane potential follows a typical curve displayed in Figure \ref{fig:action-potential}. Once a trigger event has prompted depolarization achieving the threshold, an action potential is initiated \cite{KandelBook2003:7}. It causes further abrupt depolarization of the neuron's membrane. Once the potential reaches its peak (approximately $30$ mV \cite{Izhikevich2003}), the neuron repolarizes just as quickly, returning to the resting state. After the repolarization is complete, the neuron enters a temporary hyperpolarization state, after which it works to reestablish the resting state. The entire process lasts only a few milliseconds.

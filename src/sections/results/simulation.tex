\subsection{Simulation results}

For the input to the neural network, 25 Gabor texture stimuli have been constructed, each with a unique combination of contrast grid coarseness, as shown in Table \ref{tab:stimulus-composition-params}. Examples of these stimuli are displayed in Table \ref{tab:25patches}. The network with the parameters introduced in previous sections was simulated using input currents from each stimulus, and the resulting phase-locking values were calculated. This process has been repeated XXX times, and the average phase-locking values for each set of stimulus parameters were then calculated. The final results are shown in Table YYY.

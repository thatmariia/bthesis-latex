\section{Texture stimuli}
\label{sec:external-stimuli}

The texture stimuli being described are produced from Karimian's stimuli \cite{MaryamPLACEHOLDER}. A stimulus of interest is a rectangular grid of non-overlapping congruent equispaced grating annuli. These annuli represent circular patterns called Gabor wavelets. The grid is divided into two parts: a large background area where the contrasts of annuli vary significantly (background) and a smaller section on top of the background in the bottom right quadrant where the annuli have a more homogeneous contrast (\stimfig). The luminance of the stimuli varies between 0 (black) and 1 (white), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:full-stimulus-example}. All areas in the stimulus uncovered by annuli (void) share the same luminance of 0.5. A square-shaped patch of the stimulus \stimfig{} is selected as an input to the oscillatory network.

The present section outlines the steps involved in the construction of a luminance stimulus and the steps to convert the result into current input for the PING networks. Finally, it demonstrates the method of identifying the location of the receptive field in the visual cortex that corresponds to the stimulus in the visual field.

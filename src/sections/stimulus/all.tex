\section{Texture stimuli}
\label{sec:external-stimuli}

The texture stimuli being described is produced from Karimian's stimuli \cite{MaryamPLACEHOLDER}. A stimulus of interest is a rectangular grid of non-overlapping congruent equispaced grating annuli. These annuli represent circular patterns called Gabor wavelets. The grid is divided into two parts: a large background area where the contrasts of annuli vary significantly (background), and a smaller section on top of the background in the bottom right quadrant where the annuli have more homogenious contrast (figure). The luminance of the stimuli varies between $0$ (black) and $1$ (white), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:full-stimulus-example}. All areas in the stimulus uncovered by annuli (void) share the same luminance. A square-shaped patch of the stimulus' figure is selected as an input to the oscillatory network.

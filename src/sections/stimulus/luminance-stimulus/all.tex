\subsection{Luminance stimulus construction}

The composition of the stimulus is a rather involved process, which can be separated in the following simpler steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item construction of the Gabor annulus with maximal contrast; \\
    First, the distance from the annulus center at every pixel is computed. The pixels where this distance is smaller than the given radius of the annulus are assigned the Gabor grating luminance; others are assigned the designated void value. For more details, see Section \ref{sec:annulus-composition}.
    
    \item determining the position and coordinates of the \stimfig{} in the stimulus; \\
    We start by selecting a random position of the \stimfig{} within the stimulus given the \stimfig{} size and its distance from the center of the stimulus. From there, the center of the \stimfig{} and its pixel coordinates. For more details, see Section \ref{sec:figure-composition}.
    
    \item positioning of the copies of the Gabor annulus in the stimulus; \\
    At this step, we first determine the distance between the neighboring annuli in the grid, which is equal to the number of pixels allocated to each annulus and void around it. Then, the number of annuli in each grid row and column is determined. Finally, the set of all annuli's left top corners (starting points) is computed. For more details, see Section \ref{sec:annuli-locations}.
    
    \item assigning random contrasts to the different stimulus areas (\stimfig, ground, void) depending on their location; \\
    First, the stimulus is initialized with the void luminance. Then, the annuli with relevant contrasts are added to the matrix at locations determined in the previous step. If an annulus is located in the
    ground, its contrast is selected randomly from the range $[0, 1]$, otherwise, if it is located in the \stimfig, the contrast is selected from a smaller range. For more details, see Section \ref{sec:luminance-assignment}.
    
    \item selecting a patch from the figure for further processing. \\
    Given the patch dimensions, its concentricness to the \stimfig, and lower right quadrant location, we determine the luminance matrix of the patch.
    For more details, see Section \ref{sec:patch-selection}.
\end{enumerate}

The result of completing the aforementioned steps includes a stimulus luminance matrix and a \stimfig{} patch, examples of which are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:full-stimulus-example} and Figure \ref{fig:stim-patch-example}, respectively.

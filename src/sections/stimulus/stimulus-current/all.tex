\subsection{Current from stimulus}

This section describes the process of converting a luminance stimulus into current. The process begins by converting the luminance to local contrast. This local contrast is then converted to a frequency in the gamma band. Finally, the relationship between the frequency and the current is determined and used to convert the frequency into current.

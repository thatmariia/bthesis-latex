\subsubsection{From contrast to frequency}

Now, the intrinsic oscillation frequency $f$ of the PING network $\pingnet$ can be approximated with a linear function of the local contrast in its receptive field:
\begin{equation}
    f_\pingnet = 25 + 25 \cdot \LC_\pingnet.
\end{equation}
This relationship reflects the typical gamma frequency of a neural network in V1 following electrophysiological findings \cite{Roberts2013, MaryamPLACEHOLDER}.

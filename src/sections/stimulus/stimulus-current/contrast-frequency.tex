\subsubsection{From contrast to frequency}

Now, the oscillation frequency $f$ of the PING network $\pingnet$ can be obtained through the local contrast:
\begin{equation}
    f_\pingnet = 25 + 0.25 \cdot \LC_\pingnet.
\end{equation}
These relations reflect the typical gamma frequency of a neural network in V1.
